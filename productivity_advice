omg i spent the entire day still doing low value activities.

how to get myself to stop browsing reddit??

i figured out how to read articles faster with tldr site.
also docsbot.ai IS AMAZING for summarizing youtube videos. imma do that from here on out 

low value activities:
- scrolling social media and time spent on your phone
- 
- talking about whats on ur mind
- shopping. ur goal should be to never enter a store again.
- driving anywhere not work or home.
- decision fatigue over what to eat.


 Plan ur meals and do delivery going forward. impulse buys are exception -> i think i can plan my impulse purchases. get lots of highly fatty food and prepurchase chocolare


Plans to reduce low value activities:
- dont buy anything unless its delivered/ pickup
- stop allowing your phone to control ur life. block it. then create a cage for it so you dont use it. esp reddit and youtube
- wearing synthetic materials. cotton and bamboo only
- prevent urself from having access to the phone
- youtube transcripts for videos
- too much context switiching: keep a pomorod timer. keep a list of articles u research and a time scheduled for rwading them.
- dont go to the bathroom even if u have the urge. wait until it is coming out b4 u go. go to the toilet at 12pm everyday
- stop getting ur shopping/ups done around noon. its not efficient and is quite a waste
- get ur ups pick ups ON FRIDAYS AT 5PM. get gas on the way back.
- get ur chit chatting and context switching undercontrol. dont go up and get hot teas (im not cold anymore. just keep a giant water next to you.)
- stop getting wmotional in ur speech or bringing ur issues/thoughts into conversation. dude this is fucking harddddd to do.
- do not initiate a conversation at the start of the day. dont transition conversation. 
- what do i do if i get ansy and want to stop being in the zone? Recognize u are losong focus and context switching. mutter that u are losing focus and need to get bakc in the zone for the rest of ur pomorodo timer. what if i have lower back pain? pomorodo timer then idk. pomorodo timer for candy addiction
- preplanning meals. 

every sunday:
laundry and weekly planning. 

Every OTHER sat/Sunday routine:
preplan what ur meal options could be and segment into portions sizes into plastic bags. make mixed veggie and nut bags.
purchase meals for delivery
Cook all meals and put things in freezer
Take out garbage. only make enough garbage to last 2 weeks. stop accepting reciepts + delivery only.
