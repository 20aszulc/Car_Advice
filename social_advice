How did you overshare and say such stupid things?

how did i talk about beds and why i dont own a bed?

what i did wrong:
1) you gave more than 1 fact abouth teeth
2) you talked about your own teeth brushing routine. 
3) how the hell did it go on about my living situation and living out of a suitcase and how i dont own a bed??????

4) ask morr questions about memory foam. 
STOP WITH THE FUCKING I STATEMENTS YOU DUMBASS.
